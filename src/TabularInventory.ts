    To whomever is reading this:
        I'm experimenting with a form of 'inventory' system that may or may
        not be needed in singularity update. I might even need it in this update
        though unlikely.


    The specs of the tabular inventory are as follows
        **Object oriented, and preferably boilerplate minimal
        -The tabular inventory should display (row * columns) different items at once, which may or may not be empty
        -Instances of 'items' should populate the top leftmost cell, and if the inventory is full trash the item
        -Ability to delete items, while keeping every other item in place.
        -Ideally, a way to 'sort' inventory which uses some priority (to be specified) and moves all
            items to the top left*/

// Current ideas:
//  For implementing items, it should be a separate class that is accepted by TabularInventory funcs
//  We can actually make population an O(n) worst case task through ordering the inventory and tracking the lowest
//      unpopulated cell


export class TabularInventory {
  // Potential Idea: dynamic inventory size based on row, column var defined ?
  rows = 3
  columns = 10
  items: TabularItem[] = []
  lowestPopulated = -1

  constructor(preset?: [TabularItem]) {
    let start = 0
    // If we're given a preset, of arbitrary length, set the first R*C items as preset value
    if (preset) {
      for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(this.rows * this.columns, preset.length); i++) {
        start += 1
        this.items[i] = preset[i]
        if (preset[i] == NullItem && this.lowestPopulated === -1) {
          this.lowestPopulated = i
        }
      }
    }
    // If preset is shorter than rows * columns then you want to populate the rest with empty
    // I'm making this design ahead of time in case the inventory size changes.
    for (let i = start; i < this.rows * this.columns; i++) {
      if (this.lowestPopulated === -1) {
        this.lowestPopulated = start
      }
      this.items[i] = NullItem
    }
  }

  /**Deletes an instance of TabularItem from inventory at slot i, leaving behind a Null
     * Item which is not functional.
    */
  delete = (i: number) => {
    this.lowestPopulated = Math.min(this.lowestPopulated, i)
    this.items[i] = NullItem
  }

  /**If you have inventory space, create an instance of TabularItem to inventory at slot i, and determine
     * The next available space for later.
     */
  populate = (item: TabularItem) => {
    if (this.lowestPopulated < this.rows * this.columns) {
      this.items[this.lowestPopulated] = item
    }

    let updatedPopulated = false

    //We want to find the next lowest item that can be populated later.
    //(Note: this may be able to be made into O(1) though I'm insure -Platonic)
    for (let i = this.lowestPopulated + 1; i < this.rows * this.columns; i++) {
      if (this.items[i] == NullItem) {
        updatedPopulated = true
        this.lowestPopulated = i
        break
      }
    }

    if (!updatedPopulated) {
      this.lowestPopulated = this.rows * this.columns
    }
  }
